= GeoKit

* http://geokit.rubyforge.org/

However, this is the all-in-one plugin.  We will probably remake the site to 
reflect the gem and its associated plugins.

== DESCRIPTION:

This is a gem providing modules and classes which support the development of
location-oriented applications.

This gem is a repackaging of our original GeoKit Rails plugin which bound all
this functionality together, but made it available only to Rails applications.
This repackaging is meant to enable the basic functionality to be framework
agnostic while paving the way for framework-specific plugins to build on top
of.

== FEATURES/PROBLEMS:

* Distance calculations, for both flat and spherical environments. For 
  example, given the location of two points on the earth, you can calculate 
  the miles/KM between them.
* Geocoding from multiple providers. It currently supports Google, Yahoo, 
  Geocoder.us, and Geocoder.ca geocoders, and it provides a uniform response 
  structure from all of them. It also provides a fail-over mechanism, in case 
  your input fails to geocode in one service.
* IP-based location lookup utilizing hostip.info. Provide an IP address, and 
  get city name and latitude/longitude in return.

== SYNOPSIS:

  TBD.

== REQUIREMENTS:

  TBD.

== INSTALL:
